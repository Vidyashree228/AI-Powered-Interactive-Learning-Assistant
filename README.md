#🧠 AI-Powered-Interactive-Learning-Assistant

📘 ##Introduction
The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has created opportunities to revolutionize traditional classrooms. The AI-Powered Teaching Assistant is an intelligent, real-time classroom assistant built to support teachers and students with doubt-solving, lecture summarization, multilingual communication, and interactive content generation. This tool aims to bridge gaps in classroom understanding, provide scalable academic support, and personalize the learning experience using generative AI technologies.

🎯 ##Objectives
To assist teachers in managing repetitive queries from students.
To enable students to receive real-time answers to subject-related doubts.
To summarize lengthy content (notes, lectures, videos) into key takeaways.
To generate customized quizzes and flashcards for self-assessment.
To support multilingual learning for inclusive education.
To lay the foundation for intelligent, scalable academic support in hybrid or digital classrooms.

🧩 ##Brief Description of the Project
The AI Teaching Assistant acts as a digital co-teacher. It uses APIs like OpenAI and Gemini to process student questions and give accurate, concise answers. Teachers can upload lecture slides or notes, and the assistant can summarize them or generate quizzes. The assistant can also extract key points from YouTube lecture videos and convert spoken questions into text using Whisper or browser-based voice APIs.With features like document summarization, MCQ creation, and doubt resolution, the tool enables personalized learning without overwhelming educators. It’s hosted as a web app with an interactive UI, making it accessible on mobile and desktop devices.
